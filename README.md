# Tropical Sandpiles
Simulations of tropical sandpiles and tropical curves.
 - sandpile1 outputs a file called grid.dat which contains a representation of the final state of the sandpile.
 - visualizegrid reads grid.dat and displays the final state of the sandpile.

These programs are part of work with Nikita Kalinin, Ernesto Lupercio, Mikhail Shkolnikov and Yulieth Prieto.
